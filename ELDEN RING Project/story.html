                                            <h2>Tarnished of the Lands Between</h2>

                                                <p class="p1">The Golden Order has been shattered. Throughout the Lands Between, Demigods holding shards of the Elden Ring squabble and make war over <br> the ruins of a perfect realm, now abandoned by the golden guidance of the Greater Will.</p>
                                                <p class="p1">As the echoes of this conflict thunder in the distance, an outcast arrives. Once, their ancestors called the Lands Between home, but the blessed light <br> of grace was lost to their tribe long ago and they were expelled from the kingdom. They are the Tarnished, and they have returned to claim the <br> Elden Lordship promised to them by legend.</p>
                                                <p class="p1">This is the world of ELDEN RING. As a Tarnished, the Lands Between await your exploration. You will ride through the vast fields, gallop over rolling <br> hills, and leap to the top of rocky crags on your ephemeral steed, revealing a world teeming with life and danger.</p>
                                                <p class="p1">In the grand fields where your journey begins, mythic creatures prowl the veldts, ineffable horrors lurk in the bogs and marshes, and all manner of <br> soldiers and itinerant warriors are waiting for those who wander unawares. Shy creatures nibble on sweet grasses or scuttle through the underbrush. </p>
                                                <p class="p1">Those few inhabitants who are not mad or hostile linger near the broken remnants of cities left behind by the Shattering. They may have answers for <br> you, if you help them. Above them all, ensconced in vast legacies bristling with traps, secrets, and guardians, the Demigods – warped Lords who <br> began as members of a royal and noble family – rule their domains with the unyielding power granted by shards of the Elden Ring.</p>

                                                <p class="p3">The guidance of lost graces – should you find them - will put you on a road to re-take these lands from the Demigods through might and magic, but <br> you need not follow their path.</p>
                                                <p class="p3">The choice is yours. Do you crave power, or do you seek understanding? Decide for yourself, then build your character as you see fit.</p>
                                                <p class="p3">Try dozens of skills and find one to best suit your style. Practice stealth to avoid danger or catch enemies unaware. Use the environment, the <br> weather, and the time of day to gain an advantage. Learn the art of combat , where you must read your enemy’s intentions and a well-timed dodge <br> or parry could be the difference between life and death. Ride your steed into battle against mounted mercenaries and cut them from their horses. <br> Master arcane spells from the masters that still linger among the ruins of the war. Summon familiar spirits to even the odds against you or call on <br> your fellow Tarnished to fight at your side and share the burden as you explore. Or, delve into the complex, bloody history of the Shattering and <br> discover the lost secrets of the Demigods and their kin. All these paths are possible, and more.</p>
                                                <p class="p3">Ultimately, your journey will be defined by the strength of your own ambition. The greater your goals, the greater the challenge will be. Should you <br> choose to claim the Lands Between as your birthright then yes, you must fight.</p>
                                                <p class="p3">And yes, you may die.</p>
                                                <p class="p3">But you will return to fight again.</p>
                                                <p class="p3">For that is how a champion – or a Lord – is born.</p>
